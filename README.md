### Count-CTR-and-CPC
Here I calculate CTR and CPC.


- CTR - click-through rate
- CPC - cost-per-click

I have one small dataframe:
- ad_id - identifier of the advertising (ad);
- xyz_campaign_id â€“ advertising campaign ID in company X database;
- fb_campaign_id - Facebook campaign ID;
- age - the age group that the ad was shown to;
- gender - the gender of those who were shown the ad;
- interest - code indicating the category to which the user's interest belongs (corresponding number - interest);
- impressions - number of impressions;
- clicks - number of clicks;
- spent - the amount that the company spent on displaying the ad;
- total_conversion - the number of people who became interested in the product after viewing the ad;
- approved_conversion - number of people who bought the product after viewing the ad.
